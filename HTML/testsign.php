To use your own domain name for free with a website, you have a few options:

1. Use a free subdomain provided by the hosting service. Many free hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and
Firebase Hosting provide free subdomains you can use like yoursite.github.io or yoursite.netlify.app. These are easy to
set up in your site's DNS settings.

2. Point your domain to a free hosting service with DNS. If you already have a domain name, you can point it to a free
hosting provider by setting the DNS records. For example, set the A record to the IP address of the hosting provider.

3. Use a free dynamic DNS service. Services like No-IP, DuckDNS, and FreeDNS allow you to create a free hostname and
point a domain to it using their dynamic DNS client software on your computer. This updates the IP as needed.

4. Forward your domain to a free hosting site. Domain forwarding services from the registrar often allow you to forward
a domain you own to any URL for free. You can forward to the free hosting site.

5. Park the domain. Domain parking sets the DNS to point to the registrar's parking page. Then you can usually redirect
that page to your free hosted site.

The options above allow you to use your own domain name for free by taking advantage of free subdomains, free hosting
services, dynamic DNS, forwarding, and parking capabilities. Just point your domain to the free hosting site.
